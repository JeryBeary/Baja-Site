		<div id="team_description">SAE Baja is a student competition organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). A single seat off-road car is built from the ground up to compete against up to 200 collegiate engineering teams from around the world every year. Each year we build a car and compete in various types of competitions against other universities. Cars compete in a variety of static events including design judging, sales presentation, cost report and others.

		<div id="team_description">The Michigan Baja Race team is an entirely student-run competition team housed within the College of Engineering. Every year we design and manufacture an entirely new race vehicle from the ground up. Using our skills and knowledge, we work on systems such as the frame, brakes, panels, and guards and put them together. Team members work in the Wilson Student Project Center to machine parts, fabricate molds and assemble the new car. If all goes well the team uses the remainder of the semester to test and tune the car for the upcoming competitions.
