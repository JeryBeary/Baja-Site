			<p>Michigan Baja Racing is a unique opportunity for students to get hands-on engineering practice during their educational experience. The Michigan Baja Racing organization is entirely student run, giving students an opportunity to do more than engineering. Team members also have the chance to participate in design challenges, fundraising, material-sourcing, team organization, and project management. Without the support of our sponsors, our continued success would not be possible. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor of Michigan Baja Racing please download our current sponsorship packet and/or contact our team captain, Justin Lopas, at jlopas@umich.edu.</p>
