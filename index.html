					<div id="team_description">The Michigan Baja Race team is a student-run competition team housed within the College of Engineering. Every year we design and manufacture an entirely new off-road race vehicle from the ground up. Team members work in the Wilson Student Team Project Center to machine parts, fabricate molds and assemble the new car. If all goes well, we use the remainder of the semester to test and tune the car for the upcoming competitions.
