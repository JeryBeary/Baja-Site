		<p class = "entry">As you may know, the 2014-2015 season was the most successful in the team’s history. We placed 1st in two competitions and 2nd in the other, leaving us with a 1st place overall season trophy. Additional highlights included a trip to the design finals event in all three competitions, several first place dynamic event performances, and even a podium finish in the sales presentation event. This was in large part due to the support of all of you, and for that we are extremely grateful. That success has encouraged us to have an outstanding result this year, gaining points against competitors where we can, and continuing to improve our static and dynamic event performances and innovate on the car’s design. We have high goals for this year’s car, team, and competitions - we’re going for the overall season championship again. And, from our current progress and past performance, I am confident in the hard work of our team to make that happen</p>

		<p class = "entry">Even with last year’s success, we are revisiting the design of nearly every component on the car to ensure maximum performance of the new vehicle. The design of the 2016 car is coming along smoothly, and with about 75% of the car designed in CAD, we are on schedule to complete design work by the end of the year. Our overarching theme in the design of this year’s car is efficiency: in component mass, rotating inertia, driveline power transmission, and manufacturing time. To this end, we spent a significant amount of time this summer and fall collecting data on previous cars and analyzing mechanical design with more detail than in past years. On some key places in the car, a change in material and structural design was a large contributor to reduced mass and increased performance.
		<br>
		Where we can, we are designing for increased manufacturability of components, which leaves more time for detailed analysis work and full vehicle testing to validate our designs. Our experienced hands-on team is expanding upon our knowledge in CNC machining and other processes to further decrease manufacturing time and increase quality of our parts. With even more custom parts slated for use on the new vehicle as compared to previous cars, this is critical to our success.</p>
